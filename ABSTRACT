ABSTRACT 

COLLEGE BUS NAVIGATOR 

The College Bus Navigator is a React-based 
web application designed to help students track 
college bus routes in real time. The system
provides a secure login, route details such as 
departure, arrival, duration, and frequency, and a 
live tracking interface that simulates bus movement
between stops. With visual indicators, students can 
easily identify whether a stop has been passed, is the 
current location, or upcoming.

The application is built with React,
TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI, making it responsive and
user-friendly. User sessions are maintained using
localStorage, ensuring a smooth login experience. 
Although the current version uses simulated data,
it can be extended with a backend (Node.js + Express + database) 
and GPS integration for live bus tracking.

This project demonstrates how technology can improve campus
transportation by offering transparency, convenience, and
real-time accessibility for students.
